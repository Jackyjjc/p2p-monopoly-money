## Usage Guidelines

1. Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props
2. Follow the existing patterns for state management
3. Use the CSS modules from the styles directory
4. For complex state management, consider using reducers instead of multiple useState hooks
5. For game state modifications, always use dispatch instead of direct state mutations
